1) We didnt use sudo for lab.js because we were not working with or creating any type of
server in this file.

2) lab.js reads the file plain.txt and displays its content onto the console

3) *************after readFile***************** is displayed before the contents of plain.txt
in the output because there is an asynchronous execution of functions, once the
readFile function is started it doesnt wait to finish, it moves onto the next function which
the console.log that displays *************after readFile*****************.

4) toString('utf8') converts the ASCII contents of plain.txt and converts it into
letters/text that we can read

5) we dont need .toString('utf8') because fs.readFile already gives us a Buffer by default

6) create a function that uses the files extension to determine what type of
file it is and how it should respond

7) you can combine components from homework 2 and this assignment by having the user make
requests for differnet types of data. for example instead of scheduling an appointment
you can make it so that the user requests an image or a text file and based
on the request the server will give the proper output.
